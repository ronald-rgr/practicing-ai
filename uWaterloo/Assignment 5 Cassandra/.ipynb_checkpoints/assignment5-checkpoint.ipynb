    "**Your Challenge**:  \n",
    "Design a data model for a database which stores information about all universities\n",
    "    which offer a course in Data Science.  \n",
    "    Each university has the following information: (Name, Phone, Address)  \n",
    "    Each course has the following information : (Course Name, ID, Cost, Course Registration Date)  \n",
    "    Each person has the following information: (Name, Phone, Address)  \n",
    "    Your data Model should solve the problem of storing data in Cassandra based on these Query requirements  \n",
    "    01. Find universities(including university info) near a person\n",
    "    02. Find information about a given university\n",
    "    03. Find people(Only names) interested near a university\n",
    "    04. Find courses whose registration date is in future based on universities found in Query A.\n",
    "    05. Find details about a person found in Query C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: Distance(km range) between a university and a person is already available.   \n",
    "Hint: Create a field called distance where required and use a clause on proximity for interest in a university.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions** ( 10 marks)\n",
    "1. Draw Logical Data Model using Chebotko Diagram.\n",
    "2. cql file that creates the keyspace, tables, types as required (Add 2 rows of any sample data for all the tables created).\n",
    "\n"
